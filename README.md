We are creating a multiplayer online game that we will be hosting on a server. 
The object of the game will be to fill the entire board with your player color. 
Users will take turns selecting a circle to place one of their dots. 
If the circle has n number of neighbors, once that dot has n+1 dots in it, the dots will overflow into the neighboring circles. 
This is how a user can ‘take over’ other players’ circles. Once one player fills the entire board with their color, the game is over. 
We will allow users to login and have an account which will let them save unfinished games and have a win/lose streak. 
While in a game, users can change their color and shape of dots. They can also choose from multiple board layouts before a game starts.

The first step in editing and making changes to code in github is to
make an account. I made mine using my non-miami email, though I'm
sure it would be fine either way.

If you do not have access to directly change code, but have code suggestions, go ahead and commit them
and our team will review your suggestions and decide if we want to implement them.
