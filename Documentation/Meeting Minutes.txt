Meeting on Mar. 6, 2018 - All present


        “Agenda”
        1. Finalize user stories
        2. Decide on a platform
        3. Discuss UML Diagrams and potential classes/’objects’

        Decided to make a websocket game and try to run it on a server. This would mean that we would be using JavaScript, Node.io, and         Socket.io with HTML/CSS front-end.

        Gliffy ended up not being free after all and we aren’t a big fan of DreamSpark, so for now we plan on using draw.io for our UML         Diagrams. If this software ends up being buggy or hard to work with, we will find a new online UML Diagram maker.

        Additional User Stories:
        * Users
        * Track/save unfinished games
        * Win/Lose streak
        * Leaderboard
        * Timer
        * Multiple lobbies
        * Chat (commands? whisper, help, rules etc)
        * Friends (Last iteration, maybe not at all?)


        “Class” Ideas:
        * Circles
        * Graph (contains circles)
        * Game Records’
        * User
